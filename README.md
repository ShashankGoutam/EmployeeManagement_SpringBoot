# 🧑‍💼 Employee Management System (Spring Boot)

This is a simple **Employee Management System** built using **Java 17**, **Spring Boot 3**, and **MySQL**, developed as part of my internship under the **Uneecops Trainee Program**.

It supports full **CRUD operations** for Employees and Departments, implements **data validation**, **error handling**, and includes **REST API documentation using Swagger**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔧 REST Endpoints for CRUD operations
- 🧑‍💼 Employee ↔ Department mapping (Many-to-One)
- 🛡️ Error handling with custom exceptions
- ✅ Input validation with `jakarta.validation`
- 🔐 **OAuth2 login support using GitHub**
- 🧪 JUnit 5 test cases using `MockMvc` and Mockito
- 📈 **Test coverage with JaCoCo — 80% on new code**
- 🔍 API documentation using Swagger UI
- 📊 Static code analysis with SonarCloud
- 📬 Postman collection support

## ⚙️ API Endpoints (Examples)

### 🔵 Employees

| Method | Endpoint             | Description                  |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| GET    | `/employees`         | Get all employees            |
| GET    | `/employees/{id}`    | Get employee by ID           |
| POST   | `/employees`         | Create a new employee        |
| PUT    | `/employees/{id}`    | Update an employee           |
| DELETE | `/employees/{id}`    | Delete an employee           |

Request body example for creating an employee:
```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "role": "Engineer",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "9876543210",
  "hireDate": "2025-07-28",
  "jobId": "ENG123",
  "salary": 70000,
  "department": {
    "id": 1
  }
}
```


### 🟢 Departments

| Method | Endpoint            | Description                   |
| ------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| GET    | `/departments`      | Get all departments           |
| GET    | `/departments/{id}` | Get department with employees |
| POST   | `/departments`      | Create a new department       |

---

### 🔐 OAuth2 Login (GitHub)

Login via GitHub is supported.

- Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/login

- After login, you'll be redirected to /secure which shows the GitHub username.

- Spring Security handles OAuth2 tokens securely via configuration.

- If testing locally without OAuth is needed, the test profile bypasses OAuth and CSRF safely.

---

🧪 How to Test with Postman

Start the app:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Then use Postman to hit:

```bash
GET http://localhost:8080/employees

GET http://localhost:8080/employees/10

POST http://localhost:8080/employees
```

Request Body Example:
```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "role": "Engineer",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "9876543210",
  "hireDate": "2025-07-28",
  "jobId": "ENG123",
  "salary": 70000,
  "department": {
    "id": 10
  }
}
```

### 💡 Redis Cache Test:

1. First hit: GET /employees/10 → hits DB

2. Second hit: GET /employees/10 → served from Redis

3. Run redis-cli:
```bash
KEYS *
GET employee::10
PUT or DELETE /employees/10 → cache is evicted
```

---

### 📄 Swagger UI
Once running, open:
```bash
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```
To view and test all endpoints directly.

---

### 📈 Test Coverage & Quality Gate

- ✅ 80% test coverage on new code

- 🧪 Unit & integration tests for controllers and exceptions

- 📊 Static analysis with SonarCloud

- 🛡️ Security Hotspots reviewed (e.g., CSRF disabling is limited to test profile)

---

### 🔍 SonarCloud Integration
This project includes GitHub Actions for:

- Build with Maven

- Run test cases

- Upload coverage and analysis to [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/)

Make sure to add your Sonar token and organization in GitHub secrets:
