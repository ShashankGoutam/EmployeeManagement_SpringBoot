Software Engineering Report on Employee Management System (Spring Boot)

Introduction
This report documents the application of modern software engineering principles to the design and implementation of the Employee Management System backend, developed during industrial training at Uneecops Technologies Ltd. The system is implemented with Java Spring Boot and MySQL, focusing on secure and scalable management of employee data. The full project is available on GitHub: https://github.com/ShashankGoutam/EmployeeManagement_SpringBoot

Motivation and Objectives
- Bridge the gap between classroom theory and enterprise backend development practices.
- Design and implement RESTful APIs for employee management.
- Ensure robust authentication and data security using OAuth2 social logins and JWT tokens.
- Maintain high code quality, test coverage, and clear documentation.

Software Engineering Principles Applied
- Requirements Engineering: All entities and workflows were defined before implementation to ensure system robustness.
- Modular Design: The system is architected around modular RESTful controllers and service layers, supporting extension and maintenance.
- Database Design: Normalized employee schema and ER diagrams ensure data consistency and efficient access.
- Security: OAuth2, JWT, and bearer token-based authentication restrict system access to authorized users.
- Documentation & Testing: Comprehensive API documentation via Swagger, system-level testing with Postman, and unit/integration coverage using JUnit and Mockito.

Development Methodology
This project followed an Agile methodology, organized into weekly sprints, with continuous integration and testing:
1. Requirement Gathering: Initial scoping, workflow mapping, and entity identification.
2. Design: Preparation of ER diagrams and backend architecture planning.
3. Development: Incremental implementation of CRUD endpoints, authentication features, and supporting modules.
4. Testing: Manual testing via Postman, plus automated unit and integration tests.
5. Deployment: Use of Maven for build automation and deployment in a staging environment; regular use of GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Agile’s focus on iterative development enabled rapid feedback and adaptive changes throughout the project.

Implementation Overview
- Developed CRUD REST APIs for employee records (create, read, update, delete).
- Integrated OAuth2 with Google/GitHub social login; protected all sensitive endpoints with JWT.
- Documented all endpoints in Swagger.
- Achieved >80% test coverage.
- Ensured maintainable and readable code per SonarCloud analysis.

Result Analysis
- Secure, reliable, and well-documented API endpoints.
- Authentication mechanisms successfully restricted unauthorized access.
- Testing confirmed reliability and accuracy of the API under various scenarios.
- SonarCloud reports confirmed low vulnerabilities and code smells, validating maintainability.

Conclusion & Future Scope
The project successfully demonstrates real-world software engineering through modular design, robust security, and Agile methodology. The experience provided hands-on exposure to backend enterprise project workflows.

Future enhancements could include:
- Payroll and performance management modules.
- Notification services (email/SMS).
- Responsive front-end development (React/Angular).
- Advanced role-based access control.
- Cloud containerization (Docker/Kubernetes).
